# Blood-Bowl
I have programmed the board game Blood Bowl in python3 and pygame. It is not yet finshed, though many functions do exist. If you like it, I would love to see some feedback and
bug reports.
I have a google website for it, but it's currently in Swedish, and the game is also only available in Swedish. I will make a English version of the website and the game if
anybody is interested...
But if you either talk Swedish or want to try it out anyways, you can download it directly from github or go to sites.google.com/view/max-bloodbowl.
